What do I want to do tomorrow?

playlist cont

- when clicking the plus icon one should get a modal popup which asks you whether to add track to existing playlist or create new one
- loving a song should allow you to go to a menu and load your favorites
- try spotify's API or create my own DB. just save the songDB in a separate file and use ajax. download some mp3s. 3hrs


-------------
- why does the first song not play? has it not finished loading?
- it's getting the automatic heigh but it's off by like 10px. I've hardcoded that in.

- github
- the numbers in fullTime are different per song and the layout of the progress area thus becomes broken in smaller views
- look out for //**
- make it mobile friendly and see if some added functionality should be added
- change fonts - songlist, header, and turntable don't all have to have same one
- add fadeIn of turntable onload
- replace placeholder cover
- testa ladda upp skitet




what does a finished music player look like?:
  functionality of e.g. spotify. standard music controls, some features like liking, adding to playlist (removing from playlist), loading songs dynamically and from external files, being able to save a user's playlists between sessions (so in a db),  little ecosystem basically, aesthetically pleasing, rethink layout
