What do I want to do next time?

- loved playlist should always be on top (pinned)
- why does the heart icon on the loved playlist change color depending on whether the currently playing song is loved or not?
- the previously playing track's pause button doesn't get switched to play button when changing tracks

- l√§gg templates i egen mapp
- make song template


- add a header section to the song list which shows playlist name. when nothing's playing it could say 'select playlist', when playing the tab could move that text to the side and display title of playlist

- be able to add song to playlist via plus button
- when clicking the plus icon one should get a modal popup which asks you whether to add track to existing playlist or create new one



playlist cont:

- add hover to playlists
- add animation to the song loads (why did this animation disappear, anyway?)



-------------
- why does the first song not play? has it not finished loading?
- it's getting the automatic heigh but it's off by like 10px. I've hardcoded that in.


- the numbers in fullTime are different per song and the layout of the progress area thus becomes broken in smaller views
- look out for //**
- make it mobile friendly and see if some added functionality should be added
- change fonts - songlist, header, and turntable don't all have to have same one
- add fadeIn of turntable onload
- replace placeholder cover
- testa ladda upp skitet
- when loading a next track the progress bar should be reset before it awaits the new currentTime

- I shouldn't do too many ajax requests. better to get an object once. but I think I'm okay atm, I have one for the playlist and one for the song (ah, when I press play I shouldn't perhaps load the song right then and there, or? actually I kinda do, right? because I don't want to download all the playlist's songs. anyway, smth to think about)
- maybe I should preemptively load the next track when I load a track. that way when I press next it just plays it rather than first having to dl it

- check out rest and spread again, they'd prob come in handy here

what does a finished music player look like?:
  functionality of e.g. spotify. standard music controls, some features like liking, adding to playlist (removing from playlist), loading songs dynamically and from external files, being able to save a user's playlists between sessions (so in a db),  little ecosystem basically, aesthetically pleasing, rethink layout
