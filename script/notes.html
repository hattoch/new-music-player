What do I want to do tomorrow?

playlist cont:
- what should the playlist container look like? should it include a taste of songs inclucded in the playlist? yes, either the names of the songs (max 3, followed by dots), or small thumbnails (too small?)
- add hover to playlists
- add animation to the song loads (why did this animation disappear, anyway?)
- add a header section to the song list which shows playlist name
- when I click next track it should play the next track in the playlist, not in songDB  

- be able to add song to playlist via plus button
- använd toggle() istället för att ha tex isPlaying...

- when clicking the plus icon one should get a modal popup which asks you whether to add track to existing playlist or create new one
- loving a song should allow you to go to a menu and load your favorites
- try spotify's API or create my own DB. just save the songDB in a separate file and use ajax. download some mp3s. 3hrs


-------------
- why does the first song not play? has it not finished loading?
- it's getting the automatic heigh but it's off by like 10px. I've hardcoded that in.


- the numbers in fullTime are different per song and the layout of the progress area thus becomes broken in smaller views
- look out for //**
- make it mobile friendly and see if some added functionality should be added
- change fonts - songlist, header, and turntable don't all have to have same one
- add fadeIn of turntable onload
- replace placeholder cover
- testa ladda upp skitet
- when loading a next track the progress bar should be reset before it awaits the new currentTime
- the contains songs line can have a "see all" button that expands a popup with the included songs
- I shouldn't do too many ajax requests. better to get an object once. but I think I'm okay atm, I have one for the playlist and one for the song (ah, when I press play I shouldn't perhaps load the song right then and there, or? actually I kinda do, right? because I don't want to download all the playlist's songs. anyway, smth to think about)
- maybe I should preemptively load the next track when I load a track. that way when I press next it just plays it rather than first having to dl it
- Use objects and classes more. like create an instance of a playlist, with keys like artist, title, etc, and built in methods like play, which plays that particular song, etc.
- check out rest and spread again, they'd prob come in handy here



what does a finished music player look like?:
  functionality of e.g. spotify. standard music controls, some features like liking, adding to playlist (removing from playlist), loading songs dynamically and from external files, being able to save a user's playlists between sessions (so in a db),  little ecosystem basically, aesthetically pleasing, rethink layout
